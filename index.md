Welcome to the BlvckEl!

I’m so excited to share my some of my little knowledge and experiences with you on CyberSecurity, infosec, and programming. I hope you enjoy your stay here and find inspiration and motivation to make some changes in your life and career.

I’d love to hear from you, so feel free to send your DM, comment or email me at Synflix.m@gmail.com if you have any questions or comments on this blog.
